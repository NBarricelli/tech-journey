# **AD DC Configuration**

## **Introduction**
Now that I have my DC created, a test account created, and a PC joined to the domain, I can start configuring group policies and add a print server.

## **Group Policies**
I first create three Organizational Units to keep everything separated and clean: Lab Users, Lab Computers, and Lab SVC Accounts. Within the Lab Users OU are two more OUs: Standard User and Limited User.
